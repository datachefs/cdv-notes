Now that we know what we want to accomplish and why, how do we pull it off? By following these 5 principles:

### 1. [Organizing over Tech](/pages/how/organizing/organizing.html)

The key to success is to think of this as an organizing project around tech rather than a tech project that involves some organizing:
- Leadership development: vs just relying on staff
  - Not just for community organizers and techies but also tech leadership development for artists & graphic designers
  - Not just trying to create creative dataviz, but creating a safe testing ground and a place to start building grassroots power at the scale it would take to bend the moral arc of Big Tech towards justice
- Building an ecosystem (citizenship schools, Extension Services)
- Counting on Boot Camp's isn't going to cut it
- And if the goal is to lay the groundwork for building a social infrastructure that has a shot at transforming tech, it means developing not just skills but leaders (a less intense form of Citizenship Schools)

### 2. [Scale over Elaborate One-Off's](/pages/how/scale/scale.html)

To have the impact we want, focus on getting lots of folks to do it over elaborate one-off's
- Why is it so important for people to get this?
- Otherwise how do we possibly get to the bigger picture, the opportunities for having a more fundamental impact? Don't have to succeed everywhere, but really need to keep our eyes on the prize, and that means you have to think at scale
- needed to build power -- not asking but taking a seat at the table, power to cut deals
- And that means that even the pilots have to tip their toe in the water of thinking at scale, just beginning to test out a tiny bit some of the ideas that would be needed
- Being this ambitious can feel overwhelming; that's why we use iteration (see below)



### 3. [Code Recipes over Point-And-Click](/pages/how/coding-writing/coding-writing.html)

Point-and-click isn't bad, but:
-  It's [prohibitively expensive]() to build if we want to be truly creative
- It makes it much harder to build a glide path from [tool user to tool maker]()
-It doesn't give us the same fighting chance at cracking the door open to much bigger possibilitiesk.

And in the era of Chat GPT, if we take a page from Audrey Lord and [the back of Nestl√©'s chocolate chip bags](), there's no reason why we couldn't create a network of members of every community who are comfortable collaboratively developing creative dataviz. The key: create an ecosystem that identifies [adventurous beginners]() and develops them into leaders -- and that embraces the fact that when you do it right, coding can [feel like magic]().



### 4. [Iteration over Perfectionism](/pages/how/iteration/iteration.html)

Don't try to figure out all of it all at once, don't worry too much about exactly where we are headed, take the first steps in a low risk, iterative way
- Speaking to Robert's concerns
- Substantially reducing the risk of trying this out
- Setting expectations low, so we feel comfortable making mistakes, messing around -- and working by a set of rules that makes it feel safe to be vulnerable, to mess around, to make mistakes
- Report as kindling

And here's a draft of a [plan](./plan/) built around these principles, plus criteria for success.

The end result: {Some reference back to the quote from Citizenship School about developing leaders, plus a nod to what's next}
