Now that we know what we want to accomplish and why, how do we pull it off? By following these 5 principles:

1. [Organizing over Tech](/pages/how/organizing/organizing.html): the key to success is to think of this as an organizing project around tech rather than a tech project that involves some organizing

2. [Simple Coding/Writing over Point-And-Click](/pages/how/coding-writing/coding-writing.html): 
why coding, a.k.a. recipes for computers, is the only sustainable way to go for truly creative dataviz

3. [Operating at Scale over Elaborate One-Off's](/pages/how/scale/scale.html): to have the impact we want, focus on getting lots of folks to do it over elaborate one-off's

4. [Adventurous Beginners over Everyone All at Once](/pages/how/adventurous-beginners/adventurous-beginners.html): eventually we want to get a lot of folks, but at the beginning let's target "adventurous beginners"

5. [Iteration over Perfectionism](/pages/how/iteration/iteration.html): don't try to figure out all of it all at once, don't worry too much about exactly where we are headed, take the first steps in a low risk, iterative way


And here's a draft of a [plan](./plan/) built around these principles, plus criteria for success.

The end result: {Some reference back to the quote from Citizenship School about developing leaders, plus a nod to what's next}
