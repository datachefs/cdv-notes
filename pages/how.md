Now that we know what we want to accomplish and why, how do we pull it off? By following these 5 principles:

1. [Organizing over Tech](/pages/how/organizing/organizing.html): the key to success is to think of this as an organizing project around tech rather than a tech project that involves some organizing. What does that mean?
- Leadership development: vs just relying on staff
  - Not just for community organizers and techies but also tech leadership development for artists & graphic designers
  - Not just trying to create creative dataviz, but creating a safe testing ground
- Building an ecosystem (citizenship schools, Extension Services)

One of my trying to get to here?
- Counting on Boot Camp's isn't going to cut it
- Neither is just doing this with staff
- And if the goal is to lay the groundwork for building a social infrastructure that has a shot at transforming tech, it means developing not just skills but leaders (a less intense form of Citizenship Schools)


2. [Simple Coding/Writing over Point-And-Click](/pages/how/coding-writing/coding-writing.html): 
why coding, a.k.a. recipes for computers, is the only sustainable way to go for truly creative dataviz
- Why is it so important for people to get this?
- It's not that point-and-click is bad, it's that it's
  - Much more expensive to build, less flexible, much harder glide path from tool user to toolmaker
  - Much easier to create a testing ground that gives us a fighting chance at cracking the door open to much bigger possibilities
- Part of why this works: [adventurous beginners](/pages/how/adventurous-beginners/adventurous-beginners.html)
  - There are already lots of adventurous beginners out there. This is about creating an ecosystem, an atmosphere, a vibe that makes it more likely more adventurous beginners from more marginalized communities will come play (e.g., in churches), in an atmosphere that feels safe and exciting and enticing, work feels okay to be vulnerable, okay to admit that you are making mistakes, and where you feel lifted up & supported by your brothers and sisters from many different communities, urban and rural; black, brown and white; etc.
  - This is also why creative data visualization is such a great place to try to bridge the gap: it's so shiny that when you do it right, it can feel like magic, and people are more likely to get obsessed over it as opposed to, say, figuring out a better way of cleaning up data

3. [Scale over Elaborate One-Off's](/pages/how/scale/scale.html): to have the impact we want, focus on getting lots of folks to do it over elaborate one-off's
- Why is it so important for people to get this?
- Otherwise how do we possibly get to the bigger picture, the opportunities for having a more fundamental impact? Don't have to succeed everywhere, but really need to keep our eyes on the prize, and that means you have to think at scale
- And that means that even the pilots have to tip their toe in the water of thinking at scale, just beginning to test out a tiny bit some of the ideas that would be needed

4. [Iteration over Perfectionism](/pages/how/iteration/iteration.html): don't try to figure out all of it all at once, don't worry too much about exactly where we are headed, take the first steps in a low risk, iterative way
- Speaking to Robert's concerns
- Substantially reducing the risk of trying this out
- Setting expectations low, so we feel comfortable making mistakes, messing around -- and working by a set of rules that makes it feel safe to be vulnerable, to mess around, to make mistakes

And here's a draft of a [plan](./plan/) built around these principles, plus criteria for success.

The end result: {Some reference back to the quote from Citizenship School about developing leaders, plus a nod to what's next}
