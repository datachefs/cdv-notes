Now that we know what we want to accomplish and why, how do we pull it off? By following these 4 principles:

### 1. [Organizing over Tech](/pages/how/organizing/organizing.html)

The key to success is to think of this as an organizing project around tech rather than a tech project that involves some organizing:
- Just like we do in political organizing, union organizing, and community organizing, building capacity by not just relying on staff but through organizing "adventurous beginners" and skilled members
  - Not just for community organizers and techies but also tech leadership development for artists & graphic designers
- Not just technical skills but skills at building power, leadership (Citizenship Schools)
- Not just boot camps but many ways in (Extension Services)
- Data literacy: essential skill for organizing to build power, for resisting data-driven badness, for making trade-offs when you wind power, for holding people accountable
  - Not just trying to create creative dataviz, but creating a safe testing ground and a place to start building grassroots power at the scale it would take to bend the moral arc of Big Tech towards justice
- Building an ecosystem (citizenship schools, Extension Services)
- And if the goal is to lay the groundwork for building a social infrastructure that has a shot at transforming tech, it means developing not just skills but leaders (a less intense form of Citizenship Schools)
- Not just tool users but tool makers
- Again, strategically, data visualization is a great place to do this: risks are low, plenty of room for small wins, it's fun

## 2. [Scale over One-Off's](/pages/how/scale/scale.html):  

One strategy decision that comes out of our organizing-focused analysis:  to build power to have impact we want, need to focus on getting lots of folks to do it -- and do it together -- over elaborate one-off's
  - Otherwise how do we possibly get to the bigger picture, the opportunities for having a more fundamental impact? Don't have to succeed everywhere, but really need to keep our eyes on the prize, and that means you have to think at scale
  - needed to build power -- not asking but taking a seat at the table, power to cut deals
  - And that means that even the pilots have to tip their toe in the water of thinking at scale, just beginning to test out a tiny bit some of the ideas that would be needed
  - Learning from New Georgia Project, etc.
  - Paradoxically, easier to do at scale -- figuring it all out doesn't fall on staff in one local or one group
  - Working together across geography -- and not just scale but purposeful coordinated scale with an eye on the prize


### 3. [Code Recipes over Point-And-Click](/pages/how/coding-writing/coding-writing.html)

Point-and-click isn't bad, but:
-  It's [prohibitively expensive]() to build if we want to be truly creative
- It makes it much harder to build a glide path from [tool user to tool maker]()
-It doesn't give us the same fighting chance at cracking the door open to much bigger possibilitiesk.

And in the era of Chat GPT, if we take a page from Audrey Lord and [the back of Nestl√©'s chocolate chip bags](), there's no reason why we couldn't create a network of members of every community who are comfortable collaboratively developing creative dataviz. The key: create an ecosystem that identifies [adventurous beginners]() and develops them into leaders -- and that embraces the fact that when you do it right, coding can [feel like magic]().

### 4. [Iteration over Perfectionism](/pages/how/iteration/iteration.html)

Feeling a little overwhelmed? Not to worry: iteration will save the day!
- Take the first steps in a low risk, iterative way
- Setting expectations low, so we feel comfortable making mistakes, messing around -- and working by a set of rules that makes it feel safe to be vulnerable, to mess around, to make mistakes
