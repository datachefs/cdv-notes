Now that we know what we want to accomplish and why, how do we pull it off? By following these 4 principles:

### 1. [Organizing over Tech](/pages/how/organizing/organizing.html)

The key to success is to think of this as an organizing project around tech rather than a tech project that involves some organizing

Techies will often say that they want to democratize data for the sake of "empowering" people. What organizing teaches us is how to go from the vague concept of "empowering" to connecting the dots.
Organizing is about building power to make change, which also means it's about analyzing power and strategy, both in how to get to where you want to go, and how to build the power necessary to do so. In a world where data and tech are becoming increasingly important as levers of power, how do we ensure that more people in every community understand and can wield them?

By taking a page from the 1960s Civil Rights Movement Citizenship Schools,  creative data visualization is great strategic ground for:
- __Building Data Literacy__. Today, the language of data is one of the key languages of power. Creative data visualization is a great place for building literacy in that language
-  __Developing Leaders__. It's a good leverage point for building the capacity to wield power and for taking baby steps in building a grassroots economic power at the scale it would take to bend the moral arc of big tech towards justice (in a place where the risks are low, plenty of room for small wins, and it's fun)

Just like our grassroots community groups do in clinical, union, and community organizing, the way to build capacity is not to just rely on staff but through organizing skilled members and "adventurous beginners"  -- both in tech and in graphic design & art.

What we have learned the hard way is that boot camps, for example, can be a small piece of the story, but they aren't enough. As we can learn from-another wildly successful (albeit more problematic) mass democracy movement: Extension Services in agriculture -- creating ecosystem, identifying grassroots leaders, building multiple on ramps, etc.

And strategically, data visualization is a great place to do this: risks are low, plenty of room for small wins, it's fun

Principal #1 is the central organizing principle of this project. The other 3 principles come out of it:

## 2. [Scale over One-Off's](/pages/how/scale/scale.html):  

If we want to bring about fundamental change, what organizing teaches us is that small one-off's aren't going to do it. We need to operate in a way that will build enough power to actually win -- and act in a purposefully coordinated way  with an eye on the prize. And not just against one off data visualizations, but one-off efforts by just one organization.
  - And that means that even the pilots have to tip their toe in the water of thinking at scale, just beginning to test out a tiny bit some of the ideas that would be needed
  - Paradoxically, easier to do at scale -- figuring it all out doesn't fall on staff in one local or one group
  - Working together across geography


### 3. [Code Recipes over Point-And-Click](/pages/how/coding-writing/coding-writing.html)

Point-and-click can sometimes be useful, but It's [prohibitively expensive]() to build if we want to be truly creative.

The advantage of code "recipes" isn't just that it's easier to allow folks to be truly creative. It also gets back to the bigger reasons, back to thinking about this from an organizing lens:

Not just tool users but tool makers -- and to smooth the learning curve between the two
And in doing so, it gives us a fighting chance at cracking the door open to much bigger possibilitiesk.

And in the era of Chat GPT, if we take a page from Audrey Lord and [the back of Nestl√©'s chocolate chip bags](), there's no reason why we couldn't create a network of members of every community who are comfortable collaboratively developing creative dataviz. The key: create an ecosystem that identifies [adventurous beginners]() and develops them into leaders -- and that embraces the fact that when you do it right, coding can [feel like magic]().

### 4. [Iteration over Perfectionism](/pages/how/iteration/iteration.html)

Feeling a little overwhelmed? Not to worry: iteration will save the day!
- Take the first steps in a low risk, iterative way
- Setting expectations low, so we feel comfortable making mistakes, messing around -- and working by a set of rules that makes it feel safe to be vulnerable, to mess around, to make mistakes
