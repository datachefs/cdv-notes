So, why creative dataviz as a place to start?



What you can do:

If you work for a grassroots group 

If you're a member of a grassroots group
- Track 2: talk to your buddies, come up w ideas, build some examples and some videos/repos/etc, then try to get folks excited -- and talk to friends who are in other groups too
- Be respectful of why they're up to right now, but start nudging and connecting and recruiting 

If you're a graphics designer or techie who's not part of a group 
- Start playing
- Play w friends 
- Work on the election so we keep having democracy -- and look for opp to learn more what building grassroots power through organizing looks like (and read)
- Talk w friends in other states  / regions
- Look for folks who have skills you don't -- graphic designers if you're a JavaScript coder, coders if you're a designer
- Sign up to keep in touch once we get going on examples 

If you're in high school or college:
- Connect w other students
- See if teachers willing to help -- e g, maybe a class project can be to help build some examples 

Be respectful of staggering work folks already have


And learn together and have fun together!

And dream big crazy dreams about the future of tech, and ask, what's one step I can do with other people that could lead to more people working together to crack open a door
