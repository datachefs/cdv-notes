What you can do:

If you work for a grassroots group 

If you're a member of a grassroots group
- Track 2: talk to your buddies, come up w ideas, build some examples and some videos/repos/etc, then try to get folks excited -- and talk to friends who are in other groups too
- Be respectful of why they're up to right now, but start nudging and connecting and recruiting 

If you're a graphics designer or techie who's not part of a group

- (Work on the election so we keep having democracy)
- Talk w friends in other states  / regions
- Sign up to keep in touch once we get going on examples
