[I have a sense as to where the intro should end, but I don't have a good sense as to where it should begin]




- [the intro should be a roadmap, sort of an executive summary only without as many bullet points, of this Reese's peanut butter cup of stuff that I'm covering]
- [the intro should be like a slightly more expanded version of the email I would send explaining what I'm doing]
- [what's the connection between creative dataviz practical nuts and bolts
and is bigger, broader, wilder things?]

[ by the end of the intro what you people need to know?
They need to:
- be fired up about the idea of creative dataviz and that we can do something really fun and interesting
- be aware that we need to work at scale -- or just hint at it
]




Today we are at a point where we don't have to keep making the same unconscious decision. The potential for bringing creativity and theater and drama and playfulness back into working with data are almost in our grasp -- if we work together.

And if we do it right? If we take small, iterative, practical steps towards reconnecting percentages and passion, we may do more than bring a little more fun and a little more effectiveness to our daily organizing lives. With digital toys-and-chocolate, we may crack open a door that may lead to amazing possibilities.

That's the purpose of this report:
- To sketch out the practicalities of our first steps
 - To start a conversation about where the road we build might take us
