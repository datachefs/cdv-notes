A long time ago, when organizers needed to help folks understand data that felt too abstract or intimidating, sometimes they'd use objects — from pennies to felt boards to chocolate & toys — to tell their story.  Ironically, as data’s gotten more powerful & more important, most stopped doing this.  

But in the past few years, there have been advances in tech and new organizing efforts among progressive graphic designers & artists that open up new possibilities. We are now at a point where it could be possible for thousands of grassroots groups to use creative data viz — and hopefully financially help artists & graphic designers in marginalized communities.  

And if we can crack open this door, eventually it might lead to some pretty amazing directions, including giving artists and graphic designers a shot at profoundly reshaping Big Tech, starting the hard work of transforming it from generative AI's economic & creative  stripmining to a liberatory social space for economic justice & expressing all of our full humanity





[the intro should be a roadmap, sort of an executive summary only without as many bullet points, of this Reese's peanut butter cup of stuff that I'm covering]

[ by the end of the intro what you people need to know?
They need to:
- be fired up about the idea of creative dataviz and that we can do something really fun and interesting
- be aware that we need to work at scale -- or just hint at it
]




Today we are at a point where we don't have to keep making the same unconscious decision. The potential for bringing creativity and theater and drama and playfulness back into working with data are almost in our grasp -- if we work together.

And if we do it right? If we take small, iterative, practical steps towards reconnecting percentages and passion, we may do more than bring a little more fun and a little more effectiveness to our daily organizing lives. With digital toys-and-chocolate, we may crack open a door that may lead to amazing possibilities.

That's the purpose of this report:
- To sketch out the practicalities of our first steps
 - To start a conversation about where the road we build might take us

at each stage, set expectations _low_ — don’t set myself up (eg, w proof of concepts)

_NOTE: report: not on how we regulate AI, dangers, etc.; Algorithmic Justice League, etc. do much better job_
