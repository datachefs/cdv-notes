It's Friday afternoon, right after lunch, after three grueling days of wall-to-wall meetings. As the campaign's Information Manager, I've been given the worst block of time in this planning retreat to explain to a bunch of exhausted state directors some geeky changes we need to make in our process for cleaning up our data so all the hard work, all them knocking on doors in Michigan and Ohio winters, isn't lost, doesn't bleed away. So, I do what I've seen skilled organizers do: I turn data into a story that I tell with physical objects -- in this case little toys and chocolate.

These days, you're less likely to see that. Paradoxically, as data has become more and more central to building grassroots power, and as the digital tools we use allow us to gather and crunch more data than far more data than we used to, it's become rare for organizers to put on a little show.

It's not too surprising. The easier it gets to work electronically, the more we think in spreadsheets and database columns, the stranger and/or harder it seems to switch to pennies let alone felt boards.

Plus the culture of data we've learned to appropriate from the worlds of business and science don't speak in pennies or chocolate. Bar charts, gauges -- these are their lingua franca.

That's not a choice we consciously made. To the extent that there was a choice made, more likely than not it was about embracing the mantle of precision, control, certainty -- with perhaps a dash of The Revenge of the Nerds, a faint echo of revenge from those who were shoved into high school lockers and never got over it.

Today we are at a point where we don't have to keep making the same unconscious decision. The potential for bringing creativity and theater and drama and playfulness back into working with data are almost in our grasp -- if we work together.

And if we do it right? If we take small, iterative, practical steps towards reconnecting percentages and passion, we may do more than bring a little more fun and a little more effectiveness to our daily organizing lives. With digital toys-and-chocolate, we may crack open a door that may lead to amazing possibilities.

That's the purpose of this report:
- To sketch out the practicalities of our first steps
 - To start a conversation about where the road we build might take us
