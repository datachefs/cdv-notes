When I first started working on this project, I spoke to several large grassroots groups. Most said something like, this is really exciting! Talk to me after the election. And when we talk, could you bring a couple of creative dataviz examples? I like the idea, but I'm still fuzzy about how it would work.

So, here's the plan:

## Pre-Election

### 1) Recruit Volunteers for a Design Team

Primarily experienced graphic designers and artists, with a few skilled JavaScript developers

But if other people are interested in playing, we should encourage it. You want to assume minimal resources to get the job done, with an eye towards convincing large grassroots groups after the election that it's worth doing a pilot. But we don't want to lose the opportunity for other folks who get fired up to do something about it.


### 2) Create Examples and Thoughts about Next Stepa


Have several examples in mind:
- 1 example based on common needs of high energy organizing campaigns that are working across states or across several counties/regions. Although there are a number of needs that we simply can't understand unless we work closely with folks in the community, there are some needs that are common to most large-scale organizing campaigns.
- 2 examples, one simple and one complex, from research groups that closely work with grassroots groups in supporting their organizing efforts. Because these groups don't do electoral work, they've got more flexibility to come play before the election


Before GPT, the way to go would have been to create lightweight libraries. Now it's unclear. And to be honest, it may be unclear for a while -- it may take some time to figure out how to we write code in the best way in the era of GPT.




even if initial focus is on groups that work at scale, allow for little groups to bubble up



### 3) Cleanup the User Experience of Making the Examples


### 4) Begin Discussing Potential Structure, Infrastructure

But don't get ahead of ourselves

Need an approach that keeps eye on the prize of getting big but also gives lots of folks ways of plugging in and self organizing

Start playing around w ideas for 

Track 1 (Track Peanut Butter): grassroots groups that operate at scale in organizing

Track 2 (Track Chocolate):  individuals -- bottom up


## After the Election


### 1) Convene a Small Meeting of Large-Scale Grassroots Groups

Why start with a small meeting? This project is a tricky dance. At the beginning, we need to:
- Take a step that is low risk, doesn't require a substantial commitment of paid resources
- Clearly moves us along a path that will lead us to operating at scale and cracking open the door

For example, that's why we want to make sure that the pilot includes at least 2 groups that have chapters/locals in several states.

### 2) Get a few groups to commit to doing a simple part project

Will have a better idea of the criteria for good pilots after we have created several examples. But at least for now, here are a couple of things to think about:
- __Eventually strategic/useful__ -- although it may take some beginning shiny-centered iterations to get there; it may be hard to figure out what would actually be effective until we have some real world experience.
- Something where it's okay to be playful, experimental, okay to make mistakes -- low stakes, small amounts of resources, iterative, learn as you go
- Starting from simple data is a good idea
- Don't do anything that's too high-stakes. For a bigger organization, your annual convention is probably not the best place to take your first baby steps here -- although if you give yourself room to play and try and fail and try and fail, you might end up with some dataviz that are good or interesting enough to consider showing off.


What we don't want to do: spend too much time worrying about what the infrastructure to build and maintain this would look like. First we need several folks to get their feet wet. Then, when it's become clear whether this is worth it, whether the effort could payoff, we can worry more about the nuts and bolts details.

Above all, go into this with a sense of humility and playfulness. We simply don't know if this is going to pay off, and that's okay. So long as we keep expectations low and focus on learning and growing and having fun, the worse we will do is explore some cool ideas, build new relationships across groups and communities, and help us loosen up our brains to start considering other possibilities that otherwise in the day-to-day grind we wouldn't even have considered.
