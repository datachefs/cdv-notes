### Timeline

Timeline given that in the US we are at the start of a high-stakes election, and a whole lot of folks need to be Eyes on the Prize if we are going to make it.

Before GPT, the way to go would have been to create lightweight libraries. Now it's unclear. And to be honest, it may be unclear for a while -- it may take some time to figure out how to we write code in the best way in the era of GPT.

Eventually strategic/useful -- although it may take some beginning shiny-centered iterations to get there; it may be hard to figure out what would actually be effective until we have some real world experience.

Something where it's okay to be playful, experimental, okay to make mistakes -- low stakes, small amounts of resources, iterative, learn as you go

Also concrete examples of what kind of creative dataviz you might do. Starting from simple data is a good idea

And don't do anything that's too high-stakes. For a bigger organization, your annual convention is probably not the best place to take your first baby steps here -- although if you give yourself room to play and try and fail and try and fail, you might end up with some dataviz that are good or interesting enough to consider showing off.


Ideally the way it would work is:
a pilot: 2-3 grassroots organizing groups, at least one of which has local/chapters in several states
