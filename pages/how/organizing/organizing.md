What's the difference between thinking like a (typical) techie and thinking like an organizer?

A group of techies might say, "we need to democratize data!"

An organizer would say, we need to build enough grassroots power to democratize data.

Organizing is all about:
- Understanding what your goal is
 - Figuring out how much power you need to build to win -- power analysis, scale
 - Building the power -- leadership development, ecosystem, relationships, fighting together
- Being strategic: low risks, room for small wins
- Figuring out the follow-through -- what you do after you get a win


And organizing is all about understanding that grassroots power comes from people working together. It's not just about individuals, it's about the magic that happens when we stand together.

And it's about power analysis: how much power and what kind of power do we need in order to win?

(This is the point at which I need to start reading up about organizing)

If you want to reach many people, not just Boot Camp but many ways in:
ecosystem
Extension Services
Organizing / leadership development across groups -- in regions, in sectors

developing not just skills but leaders (citizenship schools)

Being strategic - why creative date of is: risks are low, plenty of room for making mistakes, plenty of room for small wins, it's fun

Not just tool users but tool makers

Leadership development of folks with data skills, but also data literacy as essential skill for organizing to build power at scale, for holding people accountable, and for helping them make trade-offs based on our values when we win power

Leadership development because your staff doesn't have enough time for this

asking: what does winning look like, and what does it take to get there?
"Democracy" isn't enough space for- it's doing it together, to build power at scale, the power to directly challenge Big Tech, power in red states and blue

And power analysis: building it so it pays for artists and graphic designers, especially marginalized communities

Why doing this through community groups is key: building relationships
Thinking big - thinking about the quantity of power needed to actually win
(power analysis)

Beginning of scale:
lots of small, uncoordinated groups can dramatically transform individualize. But they can't dramatically transform the economics of Harlem or Harlan County.
(What percent of tech wealth is reinvested in Harlem or Harlan County?)
Economies of scale

where does citizenship schools and extension services go?


## Leadership Development

If you're at a nonprofit, you might be thinking, "but our staff doesn't have time for this."

Yes, they don't.

And let's face it: do they have the tech savvy to figure this thing out? Do they have the artistic creativity or the aesthetic I to do this well? Probably not.

They also don't have the time to organize a strike. Or to build community power.

In the long term, the key to making this work well is to do what good community, union, and political organizers do: bringing new folks and help them become volunteers, then leaders.

And to do it not in just your group, but across locals or chapters, across the state. It's by doing this together that we have the best shot.


And learn from other folks - e.g., network of housing advocates across the country, progressive groups in Michigan.


"Democracy" isn't enough -- it's doing it together, to build power at scale -- the power to directly challenge Big Tech, power in red states and blue, etc.

There's nothing wrong with lots of little groups doing their own thing, but Google is not worried about them

Lots of boot camps vs citizenship schools
(again, not knocking boot camps -- can be invaluable experience. But not at scale)

What goes into the organizing section, what goes into the scale section?


Part of organizing oriented approach: building it so it pays for artists and graphic designers, especially in marginalized communities

Why doing this through community groups is key: building relationships (again, is this about scale or about organizing?). Because ultimately this is about building grassroots power

Lots of small, uncoordinated groups can dramatically transform individual lives. But they can't dramatically transform the economies of Harlem or Harlan County

(What percent of tech wealth is reinvested in Harlem or Harlan County?)



I need to cover:

stronger together: why doing this through networks, both by the type of group and by geography, is the way to go

Doesn't have to be staff. If anything, a way to bring in new volunteers and to develop new leaders (analytics leadership development?).  

End result:
- More mobilized folks
- For more decentralized places, where chapters kinda do their own thing: starting to help structure so sustainable while 

But: got so much on our plate, how do we figure out how to do this?

The same way: together.  band of brothers and sisters across groups -- in general, or by state/region, or by sector, or both/and.  Figuring out good leadership dev in tech by yourself, writing the sheets, figuring out the asks, thinking through access issues, etc:  that's a lot.  Doing it w 5 other groups, together?  And maybe w some help from movement experts in how to do leadership dev in general?  That's a different story?

Maybe even setting up groups in churches
Bring in young activists , including high school
And look for intersections. A small Atlanta church might not have folks, but if it's part of an Atlanta of progressive black churches
creating a diverse community oriented ecosystem


Ideally the way it would work is:
a pilot: 2-3 grassroots organizing groups, at least one of which has local/chapters in several states


at each stage, set expectations _low_ — don’t set myself up (eg, w proof of concepts)
