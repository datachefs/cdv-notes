where does citizenship schools and extension services go?


## Leadership Development

If you're at a nonprofit, you might be thinking, "but our staff doesn't have time for this."

Yes, they don't.

And let's face it: do they have the tech savvy to figure this thing out? Do they have the artistic creativity or the aesthetic I to do this well? Probably not.

They also don't have the time to organize a strike. Or to build community power.

In the long term, the key to making this work well is to do what good community, union, and political organizers do: bringing new folks and help them become volunteers, then leaders.

And to do it not in just your group, but across locals or chapters, across the state. It's by doing this together that we have the best shot.


And learn from other folks - e.g., network of housing advocates across the country, progressive groups in Michigan.


I need to cover:

stronger together: why doing this through networks, both by the type of group and by geography, is the way to go

Doesn't have to be staff. If anything, a way to bring in new volunteers and to develop new leaders (analytics leadership development?).  

End result:
- More mobilized folks
- For more decentralized places, where chapters kinda do their own thing: starting to help structure so sustainable while 

But: got so much on our plate, how do we figure out how to do this?

The same way: together.  band of brothers and sisters across groups -- in general, or by state/region, or by sector, or both/and.  Figuring out good leadership dev in tech by yourself, writing the sheets, figuring out the asks, thinking through access issues, etc:  that's a lot.  Doing it w 5 other groups, together?  And maybe w some help from movement experts in how to do leadership dev in general?  That's a different story?

Maybe even setting up groups in churches
Bring in young activists , including high school
And look for intersections. A small Atlanta church might not have folks, but if it's part of an Atlanta of progressive black churches
creating a diverse community oriented ecosystem


Ideally the way it would work is:
a pilot: 2-3 grassroots organizing groups, at least one of which has local/chapters in several states


at each stage, set expectations _low_ — don’t set myself up (eg, w proof of concepts)
