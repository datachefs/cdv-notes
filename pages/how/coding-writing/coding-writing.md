Start with Tollhouse cookies recipe on a bag of chocolate chips.

If you buy a bag of Hershey's chocolate chips, on the bag you'll find an iconic recipe for Tollhouse chocolate chip cookies. Nobody looks at that bag and says, "why bother? Nobody can understand scripts for creating chocolate chip cookies."

But when it comes to coding, a number of the people interviewed for this report -- smart, sophisticated people with decades of working with tech in the community -- said that if we want to create a community of community folks who are doing creative data visualization, point-and-click is the only way to go. Code scripts are just too confusing and alienating.



### 3. [Code Recipes over Point-And-Click](/pages/how/coding-writing/coding-writing.html)

Point-and-click isn't bad, but:
-  It's [prohibitively expensive]() to build if we want to be truly creative
- It makes it much harder to build a glide path from [tool user to tool maker]()
-It doesn't give us the same fighting chance at cracking the door open to much bigger possibilitiesk.

And in the era of Chat GPT, if we take a page from Audrey Lord and [the back of Nestlé's chocolate chip bags](), there's no reason why we couldn't create a network of members of every community who are comfortable collaboratively developing creative dataviz. The key: create an ecosystem that identifies [adventurous beginners]() and develops them into leaders -- and that embraces the fact that when you do it right, coding can [feel like magic]().



Not saying no point-and-click, saying troublemakers -- some easier to do by hand, some by voice.

Troublemakers as well as to users (recipe for your favorite sandwich).

Before Chat GPT, the answer was a bit more complicated, but it was pretty solid:

__Done Right, Coding Is More like Recipes__. If someone told you that the only way to learn how to cook a recipe is by having a bunch of pictures with captions, or a YouTube video, you would think they were little odd. Nobody since the idea of using a recipe is too intimidating.

Is it work at the start? Absolutely. There are all these weird times, like teaspoon and sauté that you've never heard of. But we expect that folks will gradually learn. They will make mistakes, they will burn a bunch of pancakes, and we don't expect most people to develop the level of skill of a master chef. But nobody says, this is just too hard and intimidating.

That's not by accident. We've got several decades of people, starting with Julia Childs, who have deliberately tried to make cooking less intimidating in order to spawn a whole new generation of cooks.

While there have been similar efforts with coding, although a lot of them are... well let's just put it charitably, they don't feel like they were trying that hard.

Even with programming languages that are "easy for beginners," you don't look at them and say oh yeah, clearly that was designed so beginners could pick up quickly.

But that doesn't mean that with the right ecosystem and the right infrastructure and [the right kind of beginners]() we couldn't go a long way to close the gap.

- We start out with coding recipes that are pretty close to microwaving popcorn. For example, it set up so you dump this month's data into a particular directory, the image of a chipmunk or whatever that you want animated, etc., And you are good to go

__Much of Coding Isn't That Much Harder Than Craft/Art__ 

__For Truly Creative Data Visualization, Building Point-And-Click Would Make the Project Ridiculously Expensive__ If you want to create a bar chart, creating a point-and-click interface isn't too bad.

But the whole point of creative data visualization is to... be creative. That means allowing for an enormous amount of freedom in what folks decide to do. That's orders of magnitude harder to do.

Maybe Adobe could do it. Maybe Microsoft could do it. But a community project? That's a pretty big stretch.

__Point-And-Click Doesn't Crack Open Liberatory Doors__ But even if you could figure out a way to afford to build a truly creative dataviz toolkit that was all point-and-click, it would defeat an important part of the point of working with creative dataviz: it's an opportunity to crack open doors to a bigger, deeper engagement of the community with the development of software. Now, if #1 wasn't working, and this wouldn't matter. But this is why it's worth taking a real shot at making coding work.

But now that Large Language Models like Chat GPT are here, it's a very different story. Just months after the introduction of Chat GPT, it's already possible to write remarkably complex scripts just using a paragraph or two. And we are just getting started.

For example, one of the ongoing daydreams of a lot of developers has been the idea of creating "domain specific languages." Instead of writing a bunch of geeky code, you could write a smaller set of code that encapsulated what you are trying to do at a higher level. Imagine you are creating a robot that could cook. At some level in their stack, you would want to have a cooking language that was pretty close to how recipes work -- e.g., "sauté the chicken breast until lightly browned."

Well guess what? With this new AI, domain specific languages are a whole lot closer than they used to be. Once we get to the pilots, one of the things we will want to explore with at least one pilot down the road is can we create a library but start to encapsulate enough of the creative dataviz patterns/idioms so that we can call reduce the gap between what you say to write the code and the resulting code.

None of this will be trivial. Most developers spend a lot more time modifying code than writing code and fixing code that doesn't work than writing new code. Then again, when you are learning how to bake a perfect chocolate cake, you're going to spend a fair amount of time trying and failing making mistakes before you get it right.


To people who say yes we have been trying to make coding a lot easier, I say, have you seen what error messages look like? If you were to sit down and try to come up with word vomit that would scare off beginners, odds are you'd come up with something like most coding languages' error messages. Ironically, one of the selling points of the up-and-coming AI-enhanced coding tools is that they can turn error messages us humans have created into something more humans can understand. Never send a human to do an AI's job…


__Adventurous Beginners__

that little girl

There are already lots of adventurous beginners out there. This is about creating an ecosystem, an atmosphere, a vibe that makes it more likely more adventurous beginners from more marginalized communities will come play (e.g., in churches), in an atmosphere that feels safe and exciting and enticing, work feels okay to be vulnerable, okay to admit that you are making mistakes, and where you feel lifted up & supported by your brothers and sisters from many different communities, urban and rural; black, brown and white; etc.
  - This is also why creative data visualization is such a great place to try to bridge the gap: it's so shiny that when you do it right, it can feel like magic, and people are more likely to get obsessed over it as opposed to, say, figuring out a better way of cleaning up data
- Especially now in the world of GPT
- Smoothing the learning curve

Burnt pancakes are a crucial part of adventurous beginners.
