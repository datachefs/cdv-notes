 - Use a [Community-Oriented, Inclusive Approach](/pages/strategies/community.html)


So, why creative dataviz as a place to start?

I need to cover:

stronger together: why doing this through networks, both by the type of group and by geography, is the way to go

Doesn't have to be staff. If anything, a way to bring in new volunteers and to develop new leaders (analytics leadership development?)

Before GPT, the way to go would have been to create lightweight libraries. Now it's unclear. And to be honest, it may be unclear for a while -- it may take some time to figure out how to we write code in the best way in the era of GPT.

So instead of trying to spell out the how, let's talk about the what:


Eventually strategic/useful -- although it may take some beginning shiny-centered iterations to get there; it may be hard to figure out what would actually be effective until we have some real world experience.

Something where it's okay to be playful, experimental, okay to make mistakes -- low stakes, small amounts of resources, iterative, learn as you go

And learn from other folks - e.g., network of housing advocates across the country, progressive groups in Michigan.

Explain to artists and graphic designers widescale matters -- give concrete examples

Also concrete examples of what kind of creative dataviz you might do. Starting from simple data is a good idea

Maybe even setting up groups in churches
Bring in young activists , including high school
And look for intersections. A small Atlanta church might not have folks, but if it's part of an Atlanta of progressive black churches

creating a diverse community oriented ecosystem


Ideally the way it would work is:
a pilot: 2-3 grassroots organizing groups, at least one of which has local/chapters in several states



Decouple the issues of needing to clean up/aggregate/transform the data
and doing the dataviz
just so it doesn't get overwhelming. Making progress is all about taking little tiny baby steps -- ideally little tiny baby steps that spark joy

And don't do anything that's too high-stakes. For a bigger organization, your annual convention is probably not the best place to take your first baby steps here -- although if you give yourself room to play and try and fail and try and fail, you might end up with some dataviz that are good or interesting enough to consider showing off.


There is real power and real accountability in unvarnished numbers:
- We need to have talked to 15,000 voters by now, and we've only reached 10,000
- We can't call a strike vote until we've gotten 80 more workers to sign a card check

Interpretive dances don't win elections.

I my proposing campaigns swap out data managers for dance managers? Obviously not.


Building out the pilots and beyond in an incremental, organic, iterative, pilot-oriented way



Timeline

Timeline given that in the US we are at the start of a high-stakes election, and a whole lot of folks need to be Eyes on the Prize if we are going to make it.


Nuts and bolts



Including rural groups and rural issues (e.g., public utilities and rural electric co-ops)



Talk with folks at Highlander?

where does citizenship schools and extension services go?
