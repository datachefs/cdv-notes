Why "play" is a better strategy than deep planning right now

## It's Okay to Make a Bit of a Mess

It's Okay to Make a Bit of a Mess.

It's even okay if it's a bit of a distraction -- at least that's a start. Playing with data is not the same as knocking on doors. knocking on doors is harder

Something where it's okay to be playful, experimental, okay to make mistakes -- low stakes, small amounts of resources, iterative, learn as you go

Eventually strategic/useful -- although it may take some beginning shiny-centered iterations to get there; it may be hard to figure out what would actually be effective until we have some real world experience.


Decouple the issues of needing to clean up/aggregate/transform the data
and doing the dataviz
just so it doesn't get overwhelming. Making progress is all about taking little tiny baby steps -- ideally little tiny baby steps that spark joy

Building out the pilots and beyond in an incremental, organic, iterative, pilot-oriented way

Including rural groups and rural issues (e.g., public utilities and rural electric co-ops)

at each stage, set expectations _low_ — don’t set myself up (eg, w proof of concepts)


## Planting Seeds

It's possible that the need for creative data visualization is small. That's okay. Maybe it opens the door to rethinking tools for cutting data

Or communities, techies sweating together

Or automating Si boring organizing office work

Like the best startups, we don't have to know (the best version of MVP's)

Or maybe it creates five times as many people who understand budget battles, so more organizers



Maybe it'll be like citizenship schools: the leaders it develops are more important
