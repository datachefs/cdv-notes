## Leadership Development

If you're at a nonprofit, you might be thinking, "but our staff doesn't have time for this."

Yes, they don't.

And let's face it: do they have the tech savvy to figure this thing out? Do they have the artistic creativity or the aesthetic I to do this well? Probably not.

They also don't have the time to organize a strike. Or to build community power.

In the long term, the key to making this work well is to do what good community, union, and political organizers do: bringing new folks and help them become volunteers, then leaders.

And to do it not in just your group, but across locals or chapters, across the state. It's by doing this together that we have the best shot.
