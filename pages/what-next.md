Once we've got going on creative data visualization, where might we go next?




Creative data visualization:

Game boards as dashboards

Exercising power over how we are defined
today data is often used as a way of dehumanizing people, making it easier to treat them like they're just numbers in a spreadsheet. With the tactical use of making work with data more playful, we might be able use it as a way for expressing our full creative cells, both individually and collectively, opening up small but important spaces for redefining how data is used

Re-centering values and critical fights:
from the statehouse to work sites, as hard as it is to use grassroots power to win, it can be even harder to understand what we can do once we've one. Data is often deployed in a way to make, for example, battles over budgets opaque and intimidating, something that only experts can understand. By making working with data more playful, we may be able to open up more room to take power away from budget gigs and to put people's values at the center conversation.

Getting comfortable making complex trade-offs:
it's one thing to denounce the decisions of people with power when you don't have any power. But when grassroots groups
but when grassroots groups start winning elections, they often face hard, complex trade-offs that many aren't used to having to make. By making working with data more like a game, for example, you can make it easier for members of grassroots groups to tap into the parts of themselves that are used to making difficult trade-offs in games

Better tools for wrestling with hard decisions -- e.g., climate change


We can create a model where more tech comes out of more communities.

There are many paths to get there. This might be one of them.

There are 2 big advantages of working with creative data visualization through grassroots nonprofits

First, if you want to make sure that no communities are left behind, grassroots nonprofits, including churches and unions, are a great foundation to build on. Even communities without a lot of resources almost always have a bunch of grassroots nonprofits, most of whom are embedded in their communities, many of whom are run by organic leaders in their communities. And since these grassroots nonprofits are networked together in regional and often national networks, they already have the foundations for cooperating together. Not all of them need to do it, but if a critical mass does, it could create a foundation for doing some really amazing work.

Especially given how much these communities build our culture and all this cultural wealth but still haven't really benefited from it. So this is a way of creating space to start exploring what the alternative might look like once we flip the script. Obviously it would stay there -- everyone from startups to Nike to local government will want to get on the bandwagon of creative data visualization. But that's literally where the community is -- and is organized (e.g., black churches, community centers, etc.)

(The next programming language will be English)

And the big advantage of creative data visualization? It's a great place to play with the stakes aren't too high, and so there's room to learn from -- and survive -- their mistakes.

Let's put this another way. Would you want to start with a network of community health clinics working with artists to create software for managing their healthcare records? Probably not a great idea.

But creative data visualization? Game boards as dashboards? So long as you are moderately careful, besides that you will seriously mess things up aren't that high. And if it's done right, it could be a good way of backing into increasingly more complex community-oriented projects.

After all, if you figure out fundamentally different ways of creating dashboards, that starts raising questions about whether there are fundamentally better ways of getting data into the system, and then you are on your way

And while creative data visualization isn't the same as creating new AI, if a whole new world of creative data visualization ends up sweeping not just through the nonprofit world but through the corporate world as well, it could give us a taste of what the world might look like if our tech rose out of more communities than just Silicon Valley.
