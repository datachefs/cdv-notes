Once we've got going on creative data visualization, where might we go next?

### 1. [Community-Oriented Data Literacy](/pages/what-next/data-literacy.html) For Building Grassroots Power at Scale

Blah blah blah 

### 2. [Unleashing Artists to Bend the Arc of Big Tech](/pages/what-next/artist-coders.html)

Blah blah blah 

### The Key: Holding This Lightly

The key to cracking open new doors is to hold them lightly.  

Our approach doesn't require having a magic 8 ball that accurately predicts what's possible.  At each step of the way, we ground ourselves in the here and now.  We keep asking ourselves, what can we do that is useful today and that could crack the door open to some future tomorrows?

And if these doors don't pan out? We haven't placed big bets.  All we have done is:
- Stretched our skills  -- and our understanding of what's possible
- Made new connections with other communities that could open up new opportunities to build grassroots power together
- Had some fun along the way
