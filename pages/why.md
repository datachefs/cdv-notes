In the day-to-day grind, we assume that keep people who are involved in a struggle need to get comfortable working with numbers. But there is no rational reason why that should be so. We don't assume that people should be able to work in Latin. Why should we assume that raw numbers or charts that don't speak to our senses, to our strengths as visual creatures grounded in the real world and thousands of years of experience.

But if you were to start not from the way numbers were constructed in business and in science, as tools for describing and controlling but rather from the bottom up.

If you start from there, there's no reason why our current practices are where you would end up. Building grassroots power is about heart and head. It is about being able to make smart, strategic decisions. But it's also about theater, about passion, about "fired up, won't take it no more," about "the people united will never be defeated." There's a reason why great organizing check-in meetings often feel like football rallies: you need everyone to hold themselves accountable, but you also need everyone to charge each other up, to celebrate the small wins so we have the strength to keep going, to keep grinding through the daily slog, knocking on door after door, calling phone after phone. Organizing is about calling inch by inch to make Miles.

It's also about learning to bring a sense of curiosity and playfulness. It's far too easy to get fired up and charge into a wall, to navigate fueled by adrenaline rather than looking and reflecting. It's precisely the emotional complexities that make it so hard to do well, let alone to do it at a large enough scale to make a difference, to move mountains.
