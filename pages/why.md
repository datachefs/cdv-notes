It's Friday afternoon, right after lunch, after three grueling days of wall-to-wall meetings. As the campaign's Information Manager, I've been given the worst block of time in this planning retreat to explain to a bunch of exhausted state directors some geeky changes we need to make in our process for cleaning up our data so all the hard work, all them knocking on doors in Michigan and Ohio winters, isn't lost, doesn't bleed away. So, I do what I've seen skilled organizers do: I turn data into a story that I tell with physical objects -- in this case little toys and chocolate.

These days, you're less likely to see that. Paradoxically, as data has become more and more central to building grassroots power, and as the digital tools we use allow us to gather and crunch more data than far more data than we used to, it's become rare for organizers to put on a little show.

It's not too surprising. The easier it gets to work electronically, the more we think in spreadsheets and database columns, the stranger and/or harder it seems to switch to pennies let alone felt boards.

Plus the culture of data we've learned to appropriate from the worlds of business and science don't speak in pennies or chocolate. Bar charts, gauges -- these are their lingua franca.

That's not a choice we consciously made. To the extent that there was a choice made, more likely than not it was about embracing the mantle of precision, control, certainty -- with perhaps a dash of The Revenge of the Nerds, a faint echo of revenge from those who were shoved into high school lockers and never got over it.

Today we are at a point where we don't have to keep making the same unconscious decision. The potential for bringing creativity and theater and drama and playfulness back into working with data are almost in our grasp -- if we work together.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


In the day-to-day grind, we assume that keep people who are involved in a struggle need to get comfortable working with numbers. But there is no rational reason why that should be so. We don't assume that people should be able to work in Latin. Why should we assume that raw numbers or charts that don't speak to our senses, to our strengths as visual creatures grounded in the real world and thousands of years of experience.

But if you were to start not from the way numbers were constructed in business and in science, as tools for describing and controlling but rather from the bottom up.

If you start from there, there's no reason why our current practices are where you would end up. Building grassroots power is about heart and head. It is about being able to make smart, strategic decisions. But it's also about theater, about passion, about "fired up, won't take it no more," about "the people united will never be defeated." There's a reason why great organizing check-in meetings often feel like football rallies: you need everyone to hold themselves accountable, but you also need everyone to charge each other up, to celebrate the small wins so we have the strength to keep going, to keep grinding through the daily slog, knocking on door after door, calling phone after phone. Organizing is about calling inch by inch to make Miles.

It's also about learning to bring a sense of curiosity and playfulness. It's far too easy to get fired up and charge into a wall, to navigate fueled by adrenaline rather than looking and reflecting. It's precisely the emotional complexities that make it so hard to do well, let alone to do it at a large enough scale to make a difference, to move mountains.


The why section:
- why operating at scale is important
- do I say in the why section that we are trying to build infrastructure here? That it's a two for?
Yeah, that might make sense

at each stage, set expectations _low_ — don’t set myself up (eg, w proof of concepts)
