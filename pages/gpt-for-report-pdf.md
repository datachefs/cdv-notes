# Getting a PDF of This Report

This is a "web-first" report: it was designed to be read on the web.  But what if you want or need a PDF version of it?

Welcome to to explore chat GPT!

Here's one way to do it:

Write a python script that will take a web based report at test.org and turn all of the pages into a single PDF

If you use gpt 4 -- or Bing chat or whatever else is available by the time you see this page -- you'll get back a short python script that uses a library called pdfkit.  Let's learn a little more about it.

What options does pdfkit have, and can you give me one example that sets the margins and adds a table of contents and a cover page

But what is python, and how do I install it on my windows laptop?  Ask it for instructions and a link to a video showing someone installing it and running it

What's a simple python script I can use to test that I've got python up and running?


Is all of this trivial to do?  Definitely not -- and ironically the hardest part is getting set up
(Maybe using that Anil Dash's free site with funky colors).  Or have someone who's more comfortable with tech do it -- or better yet, set it up and then help you briefly play with it

But then again, when you get started using a new piece of equipment in a kitchen, that's not trivial either (Hello Instapot!).  But we don't freak out, we don't assume we're stupid.
